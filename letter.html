            Hi there stranger! 
            My name is aslam and im here wandering into the sea looking for genuine friends. If you're looking for the same then you should keep this bottle. Im just a simple guy who loves to hear stories from people and love to have deep talks. I love a lot of things like sports, fitness etc. I think that's enough information for this letter and you'll get to know me more when you keep this bottle. 
            Until then I'll wade throughÂ theÂ seaðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
